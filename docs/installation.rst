Installation
============

fcache also requires the `appdirs <https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs>`_ package.

Pip
---

To keep things simple, install fcache using
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install fcache

This will download fcache from
`the Python Package Index <http://pypi.org/>`_ and install it in your
Python's ``site-packages`` directory.
